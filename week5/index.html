    <p>Terminator Genisys was supposed to launch a whole new era for the series.
       It was planned as the first in a trilogy, with an additional TV series
       planned somewhere down the line. Instead, it underperformed at the box
       office, got panned by critics, and generally disappointed fans. It wasn’t
       too surprising, then, when word got out a few weeks later that the future
        of the franchise could be in jeopardy.</p>

    <p>But much like the Terminator himself, the Terminator series isn’t easily
      stopped. In a recent interview, star Arnold Schwarzenegger suggested a sixth
      Terminator film could still be coming.</p>
