      <p>Schwarzenegger sat down with Weekend Today (via The Telegraph) a morning
      show on Australia’s Channel 9, for an interview. When asked about the
      possibility of his appearing in another Terminator film, the actor responded,
      “I am looking forward to it, absolutely.” That’s not an ironclad confirmation,
      and it doesn’t serve up any new details we didn’t already know. Still,
      Schwarzenegger’s comment suggests a Terminator 6 is happening — if plans had
      been scrapped, as some have speculated, he probably would have responded differently.</p>
